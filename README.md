# N. Kostin's LaTeX Templates

## Point of Caution 

The `preamblex.tex` file that I input into nearly every document (my full preamble) is extremely long. Most users will not need so many packages or such a rich variety of colors.

## What's in Here?

So far this repo contains the following:
+ A comprehensive preamble file
+ A comprehensive bibliography file
+ Standard homework template for university coursework
+ Beamer presentations
+ Short articles (includes example on good practice)

Coming soon:
+ My CV/résumé
